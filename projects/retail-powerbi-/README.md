# Power BI — Manufacturing Defect Reduction Dashboard

### 🧠 Overview
This Power BI project analyzes manufacturing defect trends to identify root causes and process inefficiencies.  
The initiative reduced defect rates by targeting the 20 % of issues causing 80 % of production errors.

### 🎯 Objective
Reduce total defects by **20 %** and improve quality consistency across models and shifts.

### 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- **Power BI** — Interactive dashboards for Pareto and shift analysis  
- **Excel / CSV** — Data prep and cleaning  
- **Pareto Analysis, ANOVA, Fishbone Diagram** — Root-cause identification  

### 📊 Key Findings
- ~80 % of defects stemmed from three production models  
- Defects were process-related, not model-specific  
- Night shift showed highest defect count  
- Weekly defect totals showed steady improvement over time  

### 📈 Results
- Reduced defect rate by **≈ 20 %**  
- Improved inspection consistency across shifts  
- Established continuous monitoring using Power BI
