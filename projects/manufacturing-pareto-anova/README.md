# Manufacturing Defect Analysis — Pareto & ANOVA

## Overview
Identifies top defect contributors and tests differences across lines/shifts.

## Objective
Prioritize fixes using Pareto; validate variance with ANOVA (p < 0.05).

## Data
Sample fields: date, line, shift, defect_type, count.

## Methods
- Pareto chart (80/20)
- One-way ANOVA
- Tukey HSD for pairwise comparisons
- Fishbone diagram for root causes

## Results (example)
- Top 3 defects = 76% of total
- Significant variance between Line A vs C (p = 0.01)
